    "### Review of Methods of Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing anomaly detection methods for stock market data can be classified based on how they transform the data prior to anomaly detection and their process of identifying anomalies. (Summary below adapted from Golmohammadi 2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformations:** Before anomaly detection begins, data must be transformed in order to handle high dimensionality, scaling, and noise and to achieve computational efficiency. This can be done in three ways: aggregation, discretization, and signal processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_Aggregation_** involves dimensionality reduction by aggregating consecutive values, typically by representing them by their average.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_Discretization_** involves converting the time series into a discrete sequence of finite alphabets, which allows you to use existing symbolic sequence anomaly detection algorithms and also to improve computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_Signal processing_** involves mapping the data to a different space in order to make it easier to detect outliers and to reduce dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Processes of Identifying Anomalies:** The current processes of identifying anomalies can be categorized into five groups: window based, proximity based, prediction based, hidden markov model (HMM) based, and segmentation based.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_Window Based:_** The time series is divided into evenly sized windows of subsequences and the distance from that sliding window to the windows in the training database determines the anomaly score. Selection of the optimal window size must be done carefully and take into account the length of the anomalous subsequence. This method can be computationally expensive (O((nl)2)), where n is the number of samples in the training and testing datasets and l is the average length of the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_Proximity Based:_** This method uses pairwise proximity between the testing and training time series using an appropriate distance/similarity kernel. The similarity measure is then used to measure the distance of every two given sequences. A k-NN or clustering method is used to calculate the anomaly score. A major disadvantage is that this method can identify an anomalous time series, but it cannot pinpoint the exact location of the anomaly. It is also highly sensitive to the similarity measure used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_Prediction Based:_** These assume that the normal time series is generated from a statistical process while the anomalies do not fit this process. However, the length of history used for prediction is very influential in locating anomalies. In addition, these methods perform very poorly when the time series was not generated from a statistical process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Based:_** In these models, the training dataset is used to build a hidden Markov model (HMM), which is then used to probabilistically assign an anomaly score to a given test time series. However, if the underlying time series is not generated from an HMM, it will perform poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_Segmentation Based:_** The time series is divided into segments. These methods assume that there is an underlying Finite State Automaton (FSA) that models the normal time series, and anomalies are detected when segments do not fit the FSA. However, the segmentation procedure may obscure anomalies.\n",
